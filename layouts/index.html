        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a researcher at the group of <a href="https://emm.icm.csic.es" target="_blank">Ecology of Marine Microbes</a> at the <a href="https://www.icm.csic.es" target="_blank">Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM-CSIC)</a> in Barcelona, working on marine microbial ecology, environmental genomics, polar microbiome and bioinformatics.
        </p>
        <p>My research focuses in understanding the relationship between the
diversity and the metabolic potential of marine microbial communities,
especially in polar latitudes and the deep ocean, as well as the potential of
their gene content for blue technology applications. To address these issues,
I analyze high-throughput environmental DNA sequencing (DNA and RNA)
using and developing bioinformatics methods in high performance
computing (HPC) environments, which has allowed me to expand our
knowledge on the ocean microbiome by reconstructing uncultured microbes'
genomes (MAGs) of underexplored environments. Some of these findings
have been published in high-impact journals, also in collaboration with
international groups and consortia. I have developed bioinformatics pipelines
to analyze environmental genomes as well as tools to interactively explore the
biogeography and genomic content of MAGs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also interested in analog photography with big old clunky cameras and sailing in patí català, a traditional wooden catamaran born in the Barcelona beaches 100 years ago.
