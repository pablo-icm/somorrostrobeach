## Overview

POLAROMICS is a multidisciplinary project integrating different areas of expertise in microbiology, ecology, genomics, bioinformatics, and evolution that share the same overall objective of understanding 1) the biogeographical patterns and ecological connectivity of microbiomes across different polar biomes, 2) the evolutionary diversification process and 3) survival strategies for the adaptation of polar microbes

The main goal of POLAROMICS is to understand the mechanisms governing the dispersion, ecological connectivity, diversification processes, and survival strategies for the adaptation of polar microbes. Despite the key importance of these processes, relatively little is known about how they operate in microbiomes across divergent polar biomes and their relevance for the resilience of polar ecosystems in the face of climate change. To accomplish its general aim, POLAROMICS pursues the following 4 specific Objectives:

## Objectives

Objective 1: To test the prevalence of microbial biogeographical patterns across polar biomes and the identification of indicator species for each biome.
Objective 2: To test the extent of ecological connectivity between different polar biomes, specifically between Arctic seawater-sea-ice; Antarctic surface vs. deep sea water, and Antarctic coastal-aquatic lagoons to determine the coexistence of species and the seed-bank persistence.
Objective 3: To test the effect of the sea-ice-microbe concentration in brines as a source of evolutionary innovation through trans-domain-horizontal gene transfer between prokaryotes and viruses.
Objective 4: To test the role of mixotrophy in polar microbiome adaptation: photoheterotrophy vs. other types of mixotrophy.

## Methodology

We employ state-of-the-art metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines to:

1. Extract and sequence environmental DNA from polar water samples
2. Assemble and bin metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)
3. Perform functional annotation and comparative genomics
4. Integrate with environmental metadata for ecological insights

## Key Findings

- Recovered over 500 high-quality MAGs from Arctic Ocean samples
- Identified novel metabolic pathways for cold adaptation
- Discovered new lineages of bacteria and archaea specific to polar waters
- Documented seasonal dynamics in polar microbial communities
