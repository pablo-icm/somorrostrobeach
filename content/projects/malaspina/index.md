## Overview

The Malaspina Expedition (2010-2011) was a global circumnavigation research project studying the deep ocean. Our contribution focused on the analysis of metagenomes from vertical profiles across tropical and subtropical oceans.

## The Expedition

Named after the 18th-century explorer Alejandro Malaspina, this Spanish research expedition:

- Covered over 32,000 nautical miles across the world's oceans
- Collected samples from the surface to 4,000 meters depth
- Visited 34 countries on all continents
- Involved over 400 scientists from 19 research institutions

## Our Research

We analyzed metagenomes from vertical profiles to understand:

- **Bathypelagic microbial communities** (1000-4000m depth)
- **Metabolic architecture** of deep ocean microbes
- **Vertical stratification** of microbial diversity
- **Biogeochemical cycling** in the deep ocean

## Key Findings

- Deep ocean harbors distinct microbial communities adapted to high pressure and darkness
- Metabolic potential differs significantly between surface and deep waters
- Identified key functional genes for carbon and nitrogen cycling in the bathypelagic zone
- Established the first comprehensive atlas of deep ocean metagenomes

## Data & Resources

- Marine picoplankton metagenomes and MAGs available on public repositories
- Published datasets cover 11 vertical profiles from tropical/subtropical oceans
