## Overview

the Malaspina 2010 Circumnavigation Expedition sampled the marine microbiome in tropical and sub-tropical oceans, from the surface down to bathypelagic  waters (~4,000 m depth) between 2010 and 2011. This expedition has contributed to the  exploration of the patterns of microbial diversity and biogeography both in the sunlit and  dark oceans.

## The Expedition

Named after the 18th-century explorer Alejandro Malaspina, this Spanish research expedition:

- Covered over 32,000 nautical miles across the world's oceans
- Collected samples from the surface to 4,000 meters depth
- Visited 34 countries on all continents
- Involved over 400 scientists from 19 research institutions

## Data & Resources

- 76 picoplankton metagenomes and 2672 MAGs from 11 vertical profiles from tropical/subtropical ocean available on public repositories.
- 58 metagenomes and 317 MAGs from the tropical/subtropical bathypelagic ocean.

## Publications

Selected publications I have authored:

- Sánchez et al. (2024). Marine picoplankton metagenomes and MAGs from eleven vertical profiles obtained by the Malaspina Expedition. *Scientific Data*
- Sebastián et al. (2024). Water aging and the quality of organic carbon sources drive niche partitioning of the active bathypelagic prokaryotic microbiome. *Limnology and Oceanography*
