## Overview

The Tara Foundation sponsors scientific expeditions to advance the knowledge of the Ocean. I have been involved in the Tara consortium participating in he analysis of global ocean plankton communities, contributing to our understanding of marine biodiversity and ecosystem function.

## The Project

The Tara Oceans consortium represents one of the largest efforts to study ocean biodiversity:

- **Expedition duration**: 2009-2013 (main expedition), ongoing follow-ups
- **Samples collected**: Over 35,000 samples from 210 stations
- **Depth range**: Surface to mesopelagic zones
- **Geographic coverage**: All major ocean basins including Arctic

## My Contributions

I have contributed to several aspects of the Tara Oceans research:

- Metagenomic analysis of plankton communities
- Reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)
- Laboratory testing on board Tara Polar Station

## Publications

Selected publications I've contributed to:

- Paoli et al. (2022). Biosynthetic potential of the global ocean microbiome. *Nature*  
- Vernette et al. (2022). The Ocean Gene Atlas v2.0: Online exploration of the biogeography and phylogeny of plankton genes. *Nucleic Acids Research*  
- Royo-Llonch et al. (2021). Compendium of 530 metagenome-assembled bacterial and archaeal genomes from the polar Arctic Ocean. *Nature microbiology*  
- Salazar et al. (2019). Gene Expression Changes and Community Turnover Differentially Shape the Global Ocean Metatranscriptome. *Cell*
