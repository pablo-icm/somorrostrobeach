## Overview

Tara Oceans is an international scientific expedition dedicated to studying the ocean and climate change. I have participated in the analysis of global ocean plankton communities, contributing to our understanding of marine biodiversity and ecosystem function.

## The Project

The Tara Oceans consortium represents one of the largest efforts to study ocean biodiversity:

- **Expedition duration**: 2009-2013 (main expedition), ongoing follow-ups
- **Samples collected**: Over 35,000 samples from 210 stations
- **Depth range**: Surface to mesopelagic zones
- **Geographic coverage**: All major ocean basins

## My Contributions

I have contributed to several aspects of the Tara Oceans research:

- Metagenomic analysis of plankton communities
- Reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)
- Analysis of biosynthetic potential in ocean microbiomes
- Viral community analysis in marine environments

## Key Discoveries

The Tara Oceans project has led to groundbreaking findings:

- Catalogued millions of new genes from ocean microorganisms
- Mapped the global interactome of plankton species
- Discovered the biosynthetic potential of the ocean microbiome
- Characterized viral-host interactions in marine systems

## Publications

Selected publications I've contributed to:

- Paoli et al. (2022). Biosynthetic potential of the global ocean microbiome. *Nature*
- Salazar et al. (2019). Gene Expression Changes and Community Turnover Differentially Shape the Global Ocean Metatranscriptome. *Cell*
- Lima-Mendez et al. (2015). Determinants of community structure in the global plankton interactome. *Science*
