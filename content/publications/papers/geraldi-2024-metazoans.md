abstract: "Metazoans represent a minute fraction of oceanic biomass but play a crucial role in ocean food webs and carbon sequestration. We used an environmental DNA (eDNA) approach to assess the patterns in metazoan taxa richness in the global ocean by examining the Malaspina 2010 metagenomic sequences dataset. We detected 14 phyla, with a dominance of arthropods and cnidarians. Metazoan taxa richness in the epipelagic ocean was higher than reported in previous global estimates and strongly related to productivity. Taxa richness and diversity decreased from the epipelagic (surface and 100–200 m depth) to the mesopelagic (300–600 m depth), and bathypelagic (1000–4000 m depth) layers. Richness significantly increased with dissolved silica, suggesting a role of diatom-derived materials as a food source and/or ballast for sinking particles. This study represents one of the first applications of eDNA from metagenomes to investigate patterns in global metazoan diversity in the ocean and suggests that eDNA is a powerful approach to assess patterns in metazoan taxa richness in the global ocean."
