abstract: "Species interaction networks are shaped by abiotic and biotic factors. Here, as part of the Tara Oceans project, we studied the photic-zone interactome using environmental factors, taxonomy, and organismal interaction data based on 313 size-fractionated plankton communities sampled across the globe. We found that weights of organismal interactions are on par with those of environmental factors in structuring community composition. The strongest and most conserved associations connect organisms that are closely related or belong to the same trophic level. This study provides a comprehensive view of the planktonic interactome and demonstrates that organismal interaction data are a critical step toward understanding community structure and its response to environmental change."
