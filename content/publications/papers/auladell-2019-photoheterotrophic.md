abstract: "Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are widespread in the ocean and contribute to marine carbon cycling through their unique photoheterotrophic metabolism. However, the long-term dynamics of these organisms remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the seasonal and interannual variability of AAP bacteria at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (NW Mediterranean) over a 10-year period using amplicon sequencing of the pufM gene, which encodes a key protein in bacterial phototrophy. We found that AAP bacteria exhibited strong seasonal patterns, with highest abundances in summer and lowest in winter. The community composition also varied seasonally, with distinct assemblages dominating in different seasons. Interannual variability was lower than seasonal variability but still significant, suggesting that long-term environmental changes can influence AAP bacterial communities. Our results provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of these important photoheterotrophic bacteria in coastal marine ecosystems."
