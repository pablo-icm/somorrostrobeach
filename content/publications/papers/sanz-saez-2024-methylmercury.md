abstract: "The deep ocean is a major reservoir of methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxin that bioaccumulates through marine food webs. However, the microbial communities involved in MeHg degradation and mercury (Hg) reduction in these environments remain largely unexplored. Here, we combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses to investigate the distribution, diversity, and activity of microorganisms carrying mer genes (involved in Hg detoxification) in bathypelagic waters of the global ocean. Our results reveal that mer genes are widespread and actively expressed in the deep ocean, with distinct community compositions between different oceanic regions. We identified key bacterial taxa involved in MeHg demethylation and Hg reduction, including members of the Alteromonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae families. This study provides the first global assessment of microbial Hg cycling in the deep ocean and highlights the importance of microbial processes in controlling MeHg levels in this understudied environment."
