abstract: "The deep ocean is one of the most unexplored biomes, and microbial processes occurring in these environments remain poorly characterized. This includes the detoxification of toxic methylmercury (MeHg), despite the fact that the deep sea is one of the main reservoirs of MeHg in the ocean. Here we characterize the genomic traits associated with mercury (Hg) resistance in the deep ocean isolate Alteromonas mediterranea ISS312, previously shown to have a high tolerance to MeHg. We also examine its transcriptomic response to MeHg exposure to better understand the mechanisms driving MeHg resistance. Our results show that the presence of a complete mer operon and putative horizontally transferred metal resistance genes could be associated with its high tolerance to MeHg. We also identify a transcriptomic response to MeHg involving the upregulation of putative transporters and stress response mechanisms outside the mer operon, as well as downregulation of membrane modifications and metabolic pathways, highlighting the complexity of the response of this species to MeHg exposure. This study advances the understanding of the Hg detoxification potential of heterotrophic bacteria in the deep ocean."
