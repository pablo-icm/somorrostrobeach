abstract: "Bacteroidetes is one of the dominant phyla in marine environments, especially in coastal areas. However, little is known about the drivers of their diversity at fine phylogenetic scales. In the present study, we identified two Bacteroidetes taxa with contrasting ecological features by examining the population dynamics of 16S rRNA gene sequences throughout a 2‐year monthly time series data set from surface seawater at a single coastal station in the NW Mediterranean Sea (Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory). While Polaribacter was most abundant during late winter‐spring, the NS5 marine group was most abundant during summer. We then investigated the distribution of Bacteroidetes internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences in samples representing different environmental conditions, including coastal and open ocean, surface and deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), as well as free‐living and particle‐attached fractions. Clear differences in the diversity and composition of the Bacteroidetes community were observed between all sample types. Differences were largest between the free‐living and particle‐attached fractions: the particle‐attached community had fewer ecotypes with more phylogenetic diversity. At the finer phylogenetic scale, most ecotypes (clusters of >97% similar ITS sequences) showed preferences for a particular environment. Interestingly, a predominant group related to the OM43 clade showed a remarkably low differentiation and occupied multiple niches, suggesting a wider ecological potential. We identified ecologically differentiated units of Bacteroidetes and suggest these should be delineated as species."
