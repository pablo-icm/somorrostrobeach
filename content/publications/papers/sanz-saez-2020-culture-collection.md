abstract: "Marine heterotrophic bacteria are key players in ocean biogeochemical cycles, yet their diversity and distribution remain poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed a large culture collection of marine heterotrophic bacteria isolated from various oceanographic regions and depths to assess their diversity and biogeographic patterns. The collection comprised 2003 isolates from surface to bathypelagic waters across tropical and subtropical oceans. We found that the culturable fraction of marine heterotrophic bacteria is dominated by a few cosmopolitan genera, including Alteromonas, Erythrobacter, and Marinobacter. However, the majority of isolates represented rare taxa with restricted geographic distributions. Our results suggest that while a core set of heterotrophic bacteria is globally distributed, regional environmental conditions shape the composition of local communities. This culture collection provides a valuable resource for future studies on the physiology and ecology of marine heterotrophic bacteria."
