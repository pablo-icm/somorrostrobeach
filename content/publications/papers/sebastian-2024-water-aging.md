abstract: "The bathypelagic realm is by volume the largest biome on Earth and harbors a significant fraction of the ocean's microbial biomass. However, the factors controlling the metabolic activity and composition of its microbial communities remain poorly characterized. Here, we used metatranscriptomics to analyze the active prokaryotic communities throughout the water column of five oceanographic stations in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic and Pacific oceans. We found a clear vertical zonation in the active community composition, with bathypelagic waters harboring distinct communities compared to shallower layers. The composition of the active bathypelagic communities was primarily influenced by water mass age and the quality of the organic carbon sources, with older waters harboring communities enriched in taxa specialized in the degradation of recalcitrant organic matter. Our results suggest that niche partitioning in the bathypelagic ocean is driven by the interplay between water mass age and organic carbon quality, and highlight the importance of considering these factors in future studies of deep ocean microbial ecology."
