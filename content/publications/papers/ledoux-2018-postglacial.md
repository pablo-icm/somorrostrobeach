abstract: "Aim: Understanding how historical and contemporary processes shaped and maintain spatial patterns of genetic diversity is a major goal for conservation biologists.  Here, we characterized the pattern of neutral genetic diversity and we inferred  underlying processes in the habitat‐forming octocoral Paramuricea clavata in the  Adriatic Sea, a peculiar phylogeographic region of the Mediterranean Sea.  Location: Eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea.  Methods: We genotyped seven microsatellites in 454 individuals of P. clavata from  13 populations recolonized after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We estimated  the levels of contemporary connectivity and genetic drift and we reconstructed the  demographic history of these populations.  Results: The pattern of spatial genetic structure resulted from the combination of  hierarchical genetic clusters and isolation by distance (IBD). A significant decrease in  genetic diversity and an increase of the frequencies of individual alleles likely due to  allele surfing from the south to the north of the area were observed as expected  after a postglacial sequential recolonization. Based on maximum likelihood analyses,  the foundation of these populations was not linked to dramatic change in population size.  Main conclusion: Oceanographic barriers to gene flow combined to the restricted  dispersal of P. clavata likely maintain the hierarchical structure and the IBD pattern.  We suggest that the latitudinal genetic gradient results from a northward “serial  founder events” recolonization. By integrating patterns and processes, we bridge  the gap between the evolutionary and the conservation biology of P. clavata, providing management guidelines, which will benefit the associated coralligenous biodiversity."
