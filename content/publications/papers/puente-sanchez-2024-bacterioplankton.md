abstract: "A major consequence of sea ice decline in the Arctic Ocean is the expected shift in phytoplankton communities towards smaller picophytoplankton cells. However, the consequences for the bacterioplankton remain largely unexplored. We investigated the changes in bacterioplankton community composition, diversity and the potential for iron acquisition along the early spring to summer transition in Dease Strait (Kitikmeot region, Nunavut) in the Canadian Arctic. Metagenomic data revealed a temporal succession of taxa with an overall increase in diversity at the onset of summer. Furthermore, despite the presence of diverse siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters throughout the ice-covered season, we observed a late-spring drop in siderophore transport genes abundance. This suggests an increase in iron bioavailability during the ice melt season. Indeed, co-abundance network and indicator species analyses showed that the early spring community was dominated by siderophore-producer taxa in comparison to the summer community, where non-producing taxa proliferated. Our analysis suggests that, at the onset of summer, the competition for iron in the free-living bacterioplankton community switched from direct to exploitative competition."
