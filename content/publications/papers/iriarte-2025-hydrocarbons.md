abstract: "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous pollutants in the global ocean, yet the microorganisms involved in their degradation and the environmental drivers controlling their distribution remain poorly understood. Using a global metagenomics approach, we assessed the distribution and diversity of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HDB) across different oceanic regions and depths. Our results reveal a widespread distribution of HDB in the ocean, with distinct community compositions between surface and deep waters. PAH concentrations were positively correlated with the abundance of specific HDB taxa, suggesting an intimate relationship between pollutant levels and microbial community structure. This study provides new insights into the biogeography of HDB and their potential role in PAH cycling in the ocean."
