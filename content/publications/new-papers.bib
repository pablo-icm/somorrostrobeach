	abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 presents a spectrum of signs and symptoms in pregnant women that might resemble preeclampsia. Differentiation between severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia is difficult in some cases.
OBJECTIVE: To study biomarkers of endothelial damage, coagulation, innate immune response, and angiogenesis in preeclampsia and COVID-19 in pregnancy in addition to in vitro alterations in endothelial cells exposed to sera from pregnant women with preeclampsia and COVID-19.
STUDY DESIGN: Plasma and sera samples were obtained from pregnant women with COVID-19 infection classified into mild (n=10) or severe (n=9) and from women with normotensive pregnancies as controls (n=10) and patients with preeclampsia (n=13). A panel of plasmatic biomarkers was assessed, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor I, heparan sulfate, von Willebrand factor antigen (activity and multimeric pattern), α2-antiplasmin, C5b9, neutrophil extracellular traps, placental growth factor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, and angiopoietin 2. In addition, microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to patients' sera, and changes in the cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on cell membranes and von Willebrand factor release to the extracellular matrix were evaluated through immunofluorescence. Changes in inflammation cell signaling pathways were also assessed by of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate methods.
RESULTS: Biomarker profiles of patients with mild COVID-19 were similar to those of controls. Both preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 showed significant alterations in most circulating biomarkers with distinctive profiles. Whereas severe COVID-19 exhibited higher concentrations of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble tumor necrosis factor-α receptor I, heparan sulfate, von Willebrand factor antigen, and neutrophil extracellular traps, with a significant reduction of placental growth factor compared with controls, preeclampsia presented a marked increase in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and soluble tumor necrosis factor-α receptor I (significantly increased compared with controls and patients with severe COVID-19), with a striking reduction in von Willebrand factor antigen, von Willebrand factor activity, and α2-antiplasmin. As expected, reduced placental growth factor, increased soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and angiopoietin 2, and a very high soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 to placental growth factor ratio were also observed in preeclampsia. In addition, a significant increase in C5b9 and neutrophil extracellular traps was also detected in preeclampsia compared with controls. Principal component analysis demonstrated a clear separation between patients with preeclampsia and the other groups (first and second components explained 42.2\% and 13.5\% of the variance), mainly differentiated by variables related to von Willebrand factor, soluble tumor necrosis factor-receptor I, heparan sulfate, and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1. Von Willebrand factor multimeric analysis revealed the absence of von Willebrand factor high-molecular-weight multimers in preeclampsia (similar profile to von Willebrand disease type 2A), whereas in healthy pregnancies and COVID-19 patients, von Willebrand factor multimeric pattern was normal. Sera from both preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 patients induced an overexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and von Willebrand factor in endothelial cells in culture compared with controls. However, the effect of preeclampsia was less pronounced than the that of severe COVID-19. Immunoblots of lysates from endothelial cells exposed to mild and severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia sera showed an increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Patients with severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia were statistically different from controls, suggesting that both severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia sera can activate inflammatory signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: Although similar in in vitro endothelial dysfunction, preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 exhibit distinctive profiles of circulating biomarkers related to endothelial damage, coagulopathy, and angiogenic imbalance that could aid in the differential diagnosis of these entities.},

	abstract = {We evaluated modifications in the hemostatic balance of different concentrations of apixaban (APIX) in 25 healthy donors and 53 patients treated with aspirin (ASA, n = 21), ASA and clopidogrel (ASA + CLOPI, n = 11), or ASA and ticagrelor (ASA + TICA, n = 21). Blood samples from participants were spiked ex vivo with apixaban 0 (APIX0), 40 (APIX40), and 160\&nbsp;ng/mL (APIX160). We assessed the effects of APIX on (1) clot formation, by ROTEM thromboelastometry; (2) thrombin generation primed by platelets; and (3) platelet and fibrin interactions with a thrombogenic surface, in a microfluidic model with circulating blood. APIX caused dose-related prolongations of clotting time with minimal impact on other ROTEM parameters. Thrombin generation was significantly inhibited by APIX160, with ASA + TICA actions showing the strongest inhibition (p \&lt; 0.01 vs APIX0). Microfluidic studies showed that APIX160 was more potent at suppressing platelet and fibrin interactions (p \&lt; 0.001 vs. APIX0). APIX40 demonstrated a consistent antithrombotic action but with a favorable protective effect on the structural quality of fibrin. APIX potentiated the antithrombotic effects of current antiplatelet regimens. APIX at 40\&nbsp;ng/mL, enhanced the antithrombotic action of single or dual antiplatelet regimens but was more conservative for hemostasis than the 160\&nbsp;ng/mL concentration.},

	abstract = {Microbial assemblages under the sea ice of the Dease Strait, Canadian Arctic, were sequenced for metagenomes of a small size fraction (0.2–3 μm). The community from early March was typical for this season, with Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria as the dominant taxa, followed by Thaumarchaeota and Bacteroidetes. Toward summer, Bacteroidetes, and particularly the genus Polaribacter, became increasingly dominant, followed by the Gammaproteobacteria. Analysis of genes responsible for microbial acquisition of iron showed an abundance of ABC transporters for divalent cations and ferrous iron. The most abundant transporters, however, were the outer membrane TonB-dependent transporters of iron-siderophore complexes. The abundance of iron acquisition genes suggested this element was essential for the microbial assemblage. Interestingly, Gammaproteobacteria were responsible for most of the siderophore synthesis genes. On the contrary, Bacteroidetes did not synthesize siderophores but accounted for most of the transporters, suggesting a role as cheaters in the competition for siderophores as public goods. This cheating ability of the Bacteroidetes may have contributed to their dominance in the summer.},

	abstract = {Documenting large-scale patterns of animals in the ocean and determining the drivers of these patterns is needed for conservation efforts given the unprecedented rates of change occurring within marine ecosystems. We used existing datasets from two global expeditions,

              and
              Malaspina
              , that circumnavigated the oceans and sampled down to 4000 m to assess metazoans from environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from seawater. We describe patterns of taxonomic richness within metazoan phyla and orders based on metabarcoding and infer the relative abundance of phyla using metagenome datasets, and relate these data to environmental variables. Arthropods had the greatest taxonomic richness of metazoan phyla at the surface, while cnidarians had the greatest richness in pelagic zones. Half of the marine metazoan eDNA from metagenome datasets was from arthropods, followed by cnidarians and nematodes. We found that mean surface temperature and primary productivity were positively related to metazoan taxonomic richness. Our findings concur with existing knowledge that temperature and primary productivity are important drivers of taxonomic richness for specific taxa at the ocean’s surface, but these correlations are less evident in the deep ocean. Massive sequencing of eDNA can improve understanding of animal distributions, particularly for the deep ocean where sampling is challenging.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of Earth's microbiomes' capacity to degrade aromatic compounds is limited by the lack of accurate tools for identifying degrading genes and their associated taxa. Additionally, these estimates are hardly compared to in situ background concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly in oceanic waters. This knowledge is important for assessing the persistence of the widespread and abundant PAHs in the environment and their interactions with microbes. Here, we present a new tool to identify aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase α-subunit (arhdA) gene sequences by combining profile-based search with phylogenetic placement in a reference phylogeny. We identified arhdA-harboring taxa in both the Genome Taxonomy Database and the Malaspina Vertical Profiles Gene Database, a gene catalog derived from metagenomes collected during the Malaspina expedition. We found that multiple ubiquitous taxa in tropical and temperate oceans harbor arhdA. The comparison of arhdA gene abundances in seawater metagenomes with the field PAH concentrations showed that higher abundances of arhdA gene copies per cell were negatively correlated with 2–4 ring PAHs, consistent with the known degradation of lighter PAHs. Gene abundances were significantly higher in the particle-associated fraction than in the free-living fraction, suggesting particulate matter as a relevant reservoir of PAH degraders. Finally, we show that PAHs, together with other environmental variables, modulate the structure of oceanic microbial communities.},
